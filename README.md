# Brickset Tracker - Vue Frontend

This is the Vue 3 frontend for my BricksetTracker project. It connects to the [Brickset Tracker - Spring Boot API](https://github.com/RobertLippai/brickset-tracker-api), letting users search for and keep track of their brick sets.

## Features
* **Dynamic Set Catalog:** Fetches and displays brick sets from the backend API.
* **Responsive Design:** Works on both desktop and mobile, featuring a collapsible hamburger menu.
* **Component-Based Architecture:** Reusable components for the Navbar, Footer, Hero Section, Set List and Set Cards.

## Tech Stack
* Vue 3
* Vue Router
* Vite
* JavaScript
* Axios
* Tailwind CSS
* Font Awesome
