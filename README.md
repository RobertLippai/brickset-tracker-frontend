# Brickset Tracker - Vue Frontend

![Vercel Deploy](https://deploy-badge.vercel.app/vercel/brickset-tracker)

This is the Vue 3 frontend for my BricksetTracker project. It connects to the [Brickset Tracker - Spring Boot API](https://github.com/RobertLippai/brickset-tracker-api), letting users search for and keep track of their brick sets.

## Live Demo

**You can try the live application here:**
**[https://brickset-tracker.vercel.app/](https://brickset-tracker.vercel.app/)**

_(Please note: The backend API is hosted on a free-tier service and may take 15-30 seconds to "wake up" on the first visit.)_

## Features
* **Dynamic Set Catalog:** Fetches and displays brick sets from the backend API.
* **Interactive Filtering:** Users can filter the set catalog by brand in real-time. The UI reactively updates based on URL query parameters.
* **Robust Data Fetching & Error Handling:** Uses `axios` for API calls, includes loading states, and gracefully falls back to placeholder data if the API is unavailable.
* **Responsive Design:** Works on both desktop and mobile, featuring a collapsible hamburger menu.
* **Component-Based Architecture:** Reusable components for the Navbar, Footer, Hero Section, Set List and cards.
* **Deployment:** Continuous Deployment with **Vercel**. Every push automatically triggers a new production build and deployment. Vercel's rewrite feature is used to proxy backend API calls.

## Tech Stack
